Welcome to my HOMEPAGE!

Having a personal website is actually the way to build your brand online. And as a web developer, this is also a good way to showcase my work. I am able to control the background images, icons, fonts and so on. This is also a valuable process to solve problems. In these days, building a personal website is a easy thing, there are many tools avaliable online, and you don't even need to know web development knowledge. All sections about youself can be easily added after some clicks. However, I choose to code by myself to improve my web developing skills. Of course, I did meet many problems and I would like to share my experiences here.

Firstly, there are several ways to build a navigation bar with some links or hocks including using ul&li and a tags. If you are going to build a vertical bar or a dropdown bar, ul&li will be quite handy, while a tags will be more suitable for a horizontal bar. So selecting a proper method is saving time in web development.

Secondly, web development is a visible presenting. A good website should be attractive for audiences. Colors should be chosen properly, and the layout should be user friendly. Key informaion should be easily accessed by audiences. In my website, I referenced the idea of BOOTSTRAP. The page was divided into several columns in each section. In this way, my website could be more well organized. 

Thirdly, I achieved the feature to let audience to contact with me. A good personal website should be a two way communication platform. Contact me section enables me to get timely information from my audiences. I utilised PHPMailer to do this feature. 

Also, one problem is not fixed yet. On the top navigation bar, I set some hocks as quick path to jump to related section. But I failed to achieve a smooth jumping style. This is not a bad thing for me, because I know I still have a space to improve and this will motivate me to dig problems.
